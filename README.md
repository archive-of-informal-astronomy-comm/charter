# Archive of Informal Astronomy Communications

The Archive of Informal Astronomy Communications was created in recognition that the Internet allows astronomers to publish useful material outside of traditional journals, yet there is no effective mechanism for these communications to be archived, indexed and cited (see [this twitter conversation](https://storify.com/aaccomazzi/non-traditional-citations-in-astronomy) for the Archive's genesis).
The Archive acts as a facilitator for archiving communications on behalf of authors and providing a structure that NASA/SAO ADS can index.

This is a working document that specifies how the Archive will work.

## Overview

- There is an "Archive of Informal Astronomy Communications" (working name);
    * The Archive has an Editor and Board that is backed by astronomy libraries and the AAS or similar organizations,
    * The Archive is fundamentally a Zenodo curated community,
    * ADS agrees to index the resources of this Zenodo community,
    * Online Publishers (such as a blog) apply for affiliation with the Archive. Each affiliated Publisher gains its own community within the umbrella AIAC community. This allows for self-moderation by Publishers while also giving oversight to AIAC. (Note: this community-in-a-community structure is an upcoming Zenodo feature).
- The Publisher posts their content to the web as usual. The Publisher retains all rights to their work, but the content must be licensed to allow for archiving.
- Only if the Publisher deems the content to be relevant to scholarly astronomy discourse do they intentionally submit the content to the Zenodo community. This also implies that content can be retroactively submitted.
    * The submission consists of the work's source content. There is no prescribed format, but it should be easily and openly readable, e.g., plaintext/markdown and images or an ipython notebook. A PDF rendering could also be provided, secondarily.
    * The deposition is made into the Publisher's own Zenodo community within the AIAC community via a submission form on Zenodo or through the REST API.
    * The Archive accepts the submission automatically because the Publisher is affiliated (trusted) and has its own community. This reduces the Archive's operational cost.
    * The Publisher gets a DOI for the content and it is up the Publisher to put this DOI into any online markup.
- ADS indexes the Archive's resources.
- If the Archive Editor/Board finds a Publisher breaching its guidelines there is some mechanism for the Publisher to lose affiliate status and have articles removed from the Zenodo community and ADS.

### Who are Publishers?

Publishers are meant to be entities that put their own content web. Each affiliated Publisher is given its community within the umbrella AIAC community. There are two conceptual types of publishers:

- **Organizations.** These are groups who typically publish to a single place on the web. For example, a Blog can be a Publisher and publish the works of many different authors.
- **Individuals.** These are astronomers who publish their own material, but potentially this material could be in different formats and be published to different sites. This is a catch-all for an individual's own blog posts, ipython notebooks, presentations, tweets, and other content that is not otherwise formally indexed by ADS. When an individual publishes through an affiliated organization that content goes to the organization's Zenodo community.
